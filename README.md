<h1>Homomorphic-Encryption-for-ML-Model-Inference</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>

The project is focused on the implementation of privacy-enhancing technologies in the context of a health-related machine learning (ML) model. 
The task is to implement a client that can query the SecureHealth API (a service that provides predictions based on a machine learning model) in a privacy-preserving way. 
For this, the API uses homomorphic encryption (Paillier Encryption Scheme) to perform encrypted arithmetic on the input feature vector and the machine learning model's weights and biases, and yield encrypted outputs. 
The task requires the implementation of a client that uses the python-paillier library to encrypt the input feature vector and send it to the SecureHealth API for encrypted inference, and decrypt the encrypted output score.
